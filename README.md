# Lokuri Website

An implementation of Brad Traversy's Build a Responsive Website | HTML, CSS Grid, Flexbox & More video (https://youtu.be/p0bGHP-PXD4).
Forked the original repository, deleted the HTML & CSS and followed the video through to get a better understanding of HTML & CSS, implement some semantic html and practice emmet. Kept original images.
